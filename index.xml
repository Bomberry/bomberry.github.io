      <description>About me  I was born in Southern California, raised in Northern California, and currently reside in Central California&#39;s San Francisco Bay Area. At a young age, I took an interest in music, computers, cooking, and Japanese language and culture. These interests have stayed with me to this day.
I went to several high schools, leaving during my junior year to continue my education at Sacramento City College, studying music, composition, sound design, psychology, and theater. I competed in several piano competitions, performed recitals, and produced two musicals while there.
After my first year, I started to pursue a cosmetology license. Yes, cosmetology. It provided the creative freedom I wanted and I was good at it — winning a few competitions. But, with less than 400 hours of lab time left before taking the State Board examines, I decided to change direction — I needed to figure out what I wanted to do.</description>

      <description>Designed a Surface app for Adobe based on an volumetric 3D painting system developed by Sebastain Mulleretererem
Defined and constructed a user experience that would directly align with Adobe XD&amp;rsquo;s design goals while adding new conventions for touch (primary)/stylus (secondary) focused user input. This includes defining interaction models and specifications for single/multi-input gestures; one hand, two hands, stylus, hand + stylus, optional 3D devince input (gyroscope).
Created toolchain for/and all UI assets and states (100+) as texture atlases (5+) with accompanied CVS files to allow for in-app rapid design exploration/iteration while maintaing format flexability (native, web, etc).
