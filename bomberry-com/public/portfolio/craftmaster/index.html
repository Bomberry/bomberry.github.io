              <p>I love all types of computer games from first-person shooters and MMORPGs to strategy simulations. I love exploring the new environments, story lines, characters, and game mechanics.  I also love deconstructing the user experience and interface of the game. This reinforces my ability to see patterns and trends for user interaction systems.<br /><br />When MineCraft came out many of my friends and their kids started playing — I joined in the fun. Exploring the world was great, but creating a home, fortress, village, or a work of art was even more rewarding.<br /><br />However, MineCraft lacked the ability to import and export these incredible creations. How could we share something we made with a friend, or load a 3D model into MineCraft? How could we show our creations with the rest of the world?<br /><br />We needed an application to provide 3D model import and export, as well as voxelization, material editing, asset management, and content sharing. From these conversations an engineer, a business developer, and myself, a product designer formed a business and CraftMaster was born.<br /><br />We then had the difficult task all startups face — to create an identity system, build a web site and social content, all while developing an engaging product our target users. This was an incredible amount of design work, but I was ready for the challenge.</p>
