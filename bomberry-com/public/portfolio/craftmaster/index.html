              <h3>Understanding the need for a solution</h3>
              <p>I love all types of computer games from first-person shooters and MMORPGs to strategy simulations. I love exploring the new environments, story lines, characters, and game mechanics.  I also love deconstructing the user experience and interface of the game. This reinforces my ability to see patterns and trends for user interaction systems.<br /><br />When MineCraft came out many of my friends and their kids started playing — I joined in the fun. Exploring the world was great, but creating a home, fortress, village, or a work of art was even more rewarding.<br /><br />However, MineCraft lacked the ability to import and export these incredible creations. How could we share something we made with a friend, or load a 3D model into MineCraft? How could we show our creations with the rest of the world?<br /><br />We needed an application to provide 3D model import and export, as well as voxelization, material editing, asset management, and content sharing. From these conversations an engineer, a business developer, and myself, a product designer formed a business and CraftMaster was born.<br /><br />We then had the difficult task all startups face — to create an identity system, build a web site and social content, all while developing an engaging product for our target users.<br /><br />This would be an incredible amount of design work, but I'm always ready for a challenge — and to practice my craft.</p>

              <h3>Mapping out a path forward</h3>
              <p>Developing a cohesive brand that can easily associate to the idea of “blocks” that is reinforced across products, website, social media, and advertising was my initial task. This required designing a logo, logotype, and associated guidelines, and to produce associated templates for marketing and communication.<br /><br />We worked together reviewing user and market research and internal business development targets, to align the project goals with the user’s needs, and to develop a plan and schedule to move forward.<br /><br />After our research, my first task was to create the logo and Masterly, a custom typeface, that would be used in the logo, for titles and headings, and includes web/app icon symbology, to reinforce the CraftMaster brand.</p>

              <h3>Logo &amp; Logotype</h3>
              <p>The challenge with the logo was to show the relationship of the app ecosystem; user-content, CraftMaster content, MineCraft content, or more familiarly as a <em>block</em>, inside of a <em>structures</em>, as part of your <em>world</em>.<br /><br />I sketched out several ideas and then started to prepare illustrations for the team to review. The idea that resonated was nested cubes, or blocks, that represent the core of the experience. Using a silhouette of a cube at an angle, we had a hexagon to use to reinforce symbology. This would be the bases of the main logo <em>bug</em> and related icons in the application.</p>

              <h3>Masterly Font</h3>
              <p>The typeface Masterly was developed to be used for the logotype, logo, and documentation to evoke a sense of being <em>blocky</em> without being composed of blocks.<br /><br />While working through brand and application asset requirements I saw that there were going to be more than one hundred assets. I wanted to create a wholistic system to keep most aspects of brand current and to keep asset size and inflation to a minimum.<br /><br />To achieve this, Masterly was extended to include all of the application icons in the unicode's private use space, as well as the custom font’s alpha, numeric, and additional typographic symbols.<br /><br />This had the added benefit of keeping everyone up to date with the assets. When the icons needed to be extended or updated, the font is regenerated and deployed, providing a single deliverable with minimal file size and consistency across apps, web site, and documentation.</p>

              <h3>Application Development</h3>
              <p>The main challenge for building the application was to define the user workflows. This process started on a whiteboard and paper sketches. This was also time for engineering to weigh in on application architecture.<br /><br />Our priority was to solidify our approach to the UI layer. We had decided to use Chromium as the foundation and (UI) top-layer. This allowed us to create a platform-agnostic HTML/CSS based interface on top of our various open-source components.<br /><br />After deciding on the UI layer, I started working on wireframes and lo-fi comps. This allowed us to focus on workspace functionality, and components, as well as test user workflows.<br /><br />As soon as there was a framework in place, I began working with engineering to present the UI layer. We could approach this in two ways, by engineering pushing controls to be styled in the UI and by presenting UI that needed to be hooked up to supporting functions.<br /><br />This process had a few bumps along the way, but after a few weeks working together the process became easy and we were able to start implementing meaningful MVP functionality into the UI and start user testing.</p>

              <h3>In conclusion</h3>
              <p>This was a tremendous endeavor. Due to licensing limitations, a path to monetization be came an issue, without significant investment in developing a standalone content platform or application, CraftMaster will remain in its current, beta state — a useable application with an average of 10 new downloads a day.<br /><br />Since the project was built around open standards and libraries, we are in the process of releasing the it as a open project on GitHub to allow for continued development.</p>
