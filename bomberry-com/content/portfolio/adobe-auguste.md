However, there were few assets to work with — everything had to be created from scratch. This would add another level of complexity to the process. I leveraged the power of Fireworks and Illustrator to help with this task, creating symbols and element templates for the UI assets. I also used Illustrator to start designing the wireframes, to illustrate my ideas, user workflows, and to start gathering feedback.<br /><br />Since the flow was simple — open an existing file or create a new one, edit (painting), and save. This meant there would be two main sections: file management and the main workspace. I started with a simple load screen, then the file management screen, and finally the main application workspace. I identified four main sections to the main workspace: the main canvas area, where the user would paint; brushes and properties; layers; and filters."

This allows a user to use one had to interact with the camera, simultaneously orbiting, rotating, and moving towards or away from the 3D canvas, all while using the other hand (or trackpad, or stylus), to paint in the 3D canvas.<br /><br />We also utilized the hardware for additional input, and extend the user experience by using the accelerometer to move the 3D canvas object, and device camera to project the 3D canvas into the real-world."

The trick was to create comps that would adhere to Adobe’s forthcoming application styling, and which would also act as the template for generating the texture atlas and associated code necessary to rapidly iterate UI changes for testing. I spent time reviewing all of the standards for the new UI I could get my hands on, then started generating a set of components in Fireworks, which I then imported into Illustrator to begin the comp designs<br /><br />I created a toolchain that would take a CSS with definitions of the sprites, generated by Illustrator, and create a CSV file to be used by engineering for ingestion.
