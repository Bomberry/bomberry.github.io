I also love deconstructing the user experience and interface of the game. This reinforces my ability to see patterns and trends for user interaction systems.<br /><br />When MineCraft came out many of my friends and their kids started playing — I joined in the fun. Exploring the world was great, but creating a home, fortress, village, or a work of art was even more rewarding.<br /><br />However, MineCraft lacked the ability to import and export these incredible creations. How could we share something we made with a friend, or load a 3D model into MineCraft? How could we show our creations with the rest of the world?<br /><br />We needed an application to provide 3D model import and export, as well as voxelization, material editing, asset management, and content sharing. From these conversations an engineer, a business developer, and myself, a product designer formed a business and CraftMaster was born.<br /><br />We then had the difficult task all startups face — to create an identity system, build a web site and social content, all while developing an engaging product our target users. This was an incredible amount of design work, but I was ready for the challenge."

The idea that resonated was nested cubes, or blocks, that represent the core of the experience. Using a silhouette of a cube at an angle, we had a hexagon to use to reinforce symbology.

I wanted to create a wholistic system to keep most aspects of brand current and to keep asset size and inflation to a minimum.<br /><br />To achieve this, Masterly was extended to include all of the application icons in the unicode's private use space, as well as the custom font’s alpha, numeric, and additional typographic symbols.<br /><br />This had the added benefit of keeping everyone up to date with the assets.

This was also time for engineering to weigh in on application architecture.<br /><br />Our priority was to solidify our approach to the UI layer. We had decided to use Chromium as the top-layer. This allows us to create an HTML/CSS based interface and to integrate with our various open-source components.<br /><br />After deciding on the UI layer, I started working on wireframes and lo-fi comps. This allowed us to focus on workspace functionality, and components, as well as test user workflows.<br /><br />As soon as there was a framework in place, I began working with engineering to present the UI layer. We could approach this in two ways, by engineering pushing controls to be styled in the UI and by presenting UI that needed to be hooked up to supporting functions.<br /><br />This process had a few bumps along the way, but after a few weeks working on the same tasks the process was easy to start implementing meaningful MVP functionality into the UI and to allow for user testing."
