#### Stanford University - Stanford University Libraries & Academic Information Resources (SULAR)
As part of SULAR's _Silicon Genesis_ I produced (and edited) two DVDs working with Rob Walker and several leaders of the dawn of the microprocessor. The First DVD _The Fairchild Chronicles_ was 3+ hours, the second DVD _The Microprocessor Chronicles_ was 4 hours. Production/Editing included audio cleanup/processing, video processing, cuts, transitions, video effects, asset design/generation, DVD authoring/mastering, package design, and finialy sales and distribution (before turing it over to Amazon).
