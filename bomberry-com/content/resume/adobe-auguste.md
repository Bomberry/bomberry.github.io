Designed a Surface app for Adobe based on an volumetric 3D painting system developed by Sebastain Mulleretererem

Defined and constructed a user experience that would directly align with Adobe XD's design goals while adding new conventions for touch (primary)/stylus (secondary) focused user input.
This includes defining interaction models and specifications for single/multi-input gestures; one hand, two hands, stylus, hand + stylus, optional 3D devince input (gyroscope).

Created toolchain for/and all UI assets and states (100+) as texture atlases (5+) with accompanied CVS files to allow for in-app rapid design exploration/iteration while maintaing format flexability (native, web, etc).
