              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p>I love the process of building branding and web sites from scratch or modernizing existing ones. So when Streamlio — a real-time cloud solution - contacted me saying they wanted to refresh their logo and build out their brand I was thrilled to take on the responsibility and work with the team. <br /><br />But how do you take an existing brand and refine and reinforce the theme without going 'over the edge?'<br /><br />Keep it simple.<br /><br />Clean up the logo. Build a coherient brand around the company charter. Create a flexable and extensible web solution. Provide a complete set of assets, documents, and templates to allow internal design and production of content.<br /><br /> This would be a huge win for the marketing and design teams. To be quick and nimble, and to save time and money. A win-win-win.</p>

              <h3>Define goals to drive the plan</h3>
              <p>The first thing I did was check who the completion was, how Streamlio was positioned, and what they wanted to achieve. This allowed us to generate a schedule and plan out the project.<br /><br />The initial assessment included competitive analysis, asset and design review, web architecture and development review, and team meetings to understand what was and wasn’t working, and what they wanted to do.</p>

              <h3>Giving the Logo some Love</h3>
              <p>Most logos are comprised of two main elements; a glyph or ‘bug’ and the word-mark.<br /><br />When starting with an existing logo you need to evaluate where it’s success and failures lie. While the original logo’s word-mark looked presentable, the logo itself would get lost when placed on various colors and hues. Part of this was due to the additional gray outlines and paths.</p>

              <p>By removing the outlines and adjusting the hue of the paths, we were well on our way.

              <p>With the logo refresh complete I realized I had to start the documentation process. Knowing that a Keynote presentation was part of the deliverables I composed the branding guidelines in it. Doing this not only saved time but allows for real-world testing of a living-document.<br /><br />From here I defined logo variations, called out white space, create a color guide, defining typography, gradients, and image use/processing was all that was completed.</p>

              <p>Now that we have a branding guideline, how do we help the teams and partners use it?<br /><br />This presented it’s own unique challenges. How does someone use the assets and guidelines, and how can we help them with this? I needed to make this process as easy as possible.<br /><br />As a Keynote presentation was already in production, styles were already set, moving them into Pages and creating another template was easy and provided another self defined document to start from. But manually entering colors in Pages, Keynote, Numbers, or even Photoshop or Illustrator would be an issue.</p>

              <h3>Beginning the Website Design</h3>
              <p>Starting the design phase of the website was the next step. During the branding development phase I reviewed their current web development toolchain and solution. Changing the process should be avoided unless there is a large positive return on the investment. In this case, they made great initial choices using HuGo, Gulp, and had a written custom scripts and shell commands to create a real-time, development and deployment workflow. All that was necessary was to find a CMS solution, and to being the design process. We chose Forestry as it has the features required and easily integrates with HuGo and the toolchain.</p>

              <h3>Information architecture and component callout</h3>
              <p>When designing a web site it is critical to keep the site visitor in mind. To present the shortest path to what they’re looking for and make it easy for them to establish contact or ask questions. Minimizing the width and depth of the site navigation, having a call to action on most pages, and providing a real-time chat option cuts down on site-use attrition and turn visitors into customers.</p>

              <h3>Lo-fi Comps and Block Templates</h3>
              <p>I produced a set of block layouts and sample web pages in Photoshop for review by the team. They were very happy with the design, and together we found a few more components that were missing. We were now set to start the codification of the designs.<br /><br />By creating a master style sheet in SASS and a modular flexible series of HTML blocks, I was able to create the required blocks. However, these were not always easy to grasp without page-context. I created sections and pages of the three example pages as a frame of reference.<br /><br />Since good choices were put in places at the beginning of the project, working wth GitHub we started to integrate the components into HuGo templates and the build system.</p>

              <h3>Launching the site</h3>
              <p>With all of the required pieces in place we flipped the switch and started generating the new site for deployment. Streamlio was happy with the solution provided, but now that it was live we noticed some odd behaviors not apparent during testing. I followed up, fixing and creating solutions for these new issues. In addition, I spent some time refactoring the code and templates, and started real-time performance testing.<br /><br />Due to the large number of images and requests, and a functional but not necessary SASS/CSS loop, the page was loading slowly on 3G or slower speeds.<br /><br />We used ImageOptim to post-process images, added JavaScript to lazy load some assets, and removed the offending SASS statement. This provided a 72% savings and made the site load faster for everyone.</p>

              <h3>The Result</h3>
              <p>Coming away from this project we see that even if planning in detail, there are going to be bumps along the road, and being able to adapt and create solutions is critical to the success of any project. I provided a guideline and helped the team with developing their online presence, assets, and documentation on how to use it all.<br /><br />In the end, I created a happy customer who I will continue to help with future projects. In addition, I look it upon myself to learn HuGo — a static site generation tool — and have started to incorporate it in current projects providing another tool to add to my toolbox. A win-win-win!.</p>
