              <h3 class="underline-center-outward">The challange</h3>
              <p>I was approached by Adobe with a unique opportunity: to develop a working demo application based on a piece of new technology that would look and feel like other Adobe apps — all in four months, in time to demo at Adobe MAX.<br /><br />The challenges of this project were many and varied: building a UI layer, designing the visual components to align with Adobe’s future application styling, creating or extending the core technology functionality, exploring and implementing new user interaction mechanics, and creating an asset toolchain and workflow to easily iterate and test designs, features, and functionality.</p>

              <h3 class="underline-center-outward">The Response</h3>
              <p>This was a big task that had a short time to produce deliverables. Project management, weekly sprints, and a quick and easy approach to building and testing the application would be critical to completing the project on time. Developing a standard set of templates in Illustrator for visual assets to reflect Adobe’s UI design goals, and to create a workflow for generating sprites and lookup maps for engineering to implement provided a flyable and reliable solution to this challenge.</p>

              <h3 class="underline-center-outward">Begin with the technology</h3>
              <p>The first task was to explore what exactly the technology was, it’s functionality, how it could be extended, who the user was, and how they would use the application. In addition, I had to approach the complexity of multi-input systems: touch, stylus, keyboard, including any combination of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, the user workflows were few and this allowed me to focus on the tasks at hand. Because of the aggressive schedule, I had to start looking at input systems at the same time as I began illustrating wireframes.</p>

              <h3 class="underline-center-outward">Wireframes and user-flow</h3>
              <p>Luckily, there were a couple of internal documents describing what the future UI of Adobe apps would look like. However, there were few assets to work with — everything had to be created from scratch. This would add another level of complexity to the process. I leveraged the power of Fireworks and Illustrator to help with this task, creating symbols and element templates for the UI assets. I also used Illustrator to start designing the wireframes, to illustrate my ideas, user workflows, and to start gathering feedback.<br /><br />Since the flow was simple — open an existing file or create a new one, edit (painting), and save. This meant there would be two main sections: file management and the main workspace. I started with a simple load screen, then the file management screen, and finally the main application workspace. I identified four main sections to the main workspace: the main canvas area, where the user would paint; brushes and properties; layers; and filters.</p>

              <h3 class="underline-center-outward">Defining multi-input system</h3>
              <p>The main goal was to create an interaction system that would allow for various input systems. This meant defining not only standard input system requirements, keyboard and mouse/trackpad input, but also stylus and touch — and they had to work together or by them selves. We also utilized the hardware for additional input, and extend the user experience by using the accelerometer, to move the 3D canvas object, and camera, to project the 3D canvas into the real-world.</p>

              <h3 class="underline-center-outward">Styling the user interface</h3>
              <p>Once the basics were in place it was time to proceed with hi-fi comps. The trick was to create comps that would adhere to Adobe’s forthcoming application styling, and which would also act as the template for generating the texture atlas and associated code necessary to rapidly iterate UI changes for testing. I spent time reviewing all of the standards for the new UI I could get my hands on, then started generating a set of components in Fireworks, which I then imported into Illustrator to begin the comp designs<br /><br />I created a toolchain that would take a CSS with definitions of the sprites, generated by Illustrator, and create a CVS file to be used by engineering for ingestion. This workflow saved time by generating documents and bypassing manual entry.</p>

              <h3 class="underline-center-outward">Putting it all together</h3>
              <p>Incorporating all of the UI and functionality was a bit tricky, and some of the additional features and UI had to be skipped for the initial internal demo, however, the app itself was well received. A sneak video of the pre-demo release was produced and pushed up to Adobe’s blog before MAX. This was well received by the general public and we quickly began to see great interest in the app itself.<br /><br />Finally, the completed demo app was produced in time for MAX. The feedback from the users was great — people loved the new tool. It felt intuitive to use and provided a new tool for creatives.</p>

              <h3 class="underline-center-outward">In conclusion</h3>
              <p>Although Project Auguste has not become a full-fledged Adobe app (yet), working on the project was a great experience, and very rewarding hearing user feedback and interest. It had it’s challenges along the way, but by keeping a living document to track features and assets, and creating tools to enable rapid integration and testing, we were able to accomplish the task in time for the MAX demo.<br /><br />Hopefully, in the not to distant future, Project August will be promoted to a demo version on Adobe Labs, or released into the wild as one of Adobe’s mobile-first apps available though Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
