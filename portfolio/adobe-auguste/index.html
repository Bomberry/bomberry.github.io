                <p class="typography-CS-section-body-light animated fadeIn wow">    When Stéfano Corazza (Project Manager) contacted me stating he had seen a technology demo from Sebastian Marketsmueller (Engineer) and wanted to make an application out of it. I was excited but wanted to hear more about the technology and who our user would be. What is the purpose?
    </p><p class='typography-CS-section-body-light  animated fadeIn wow'>
    He provided a user story, about <span class="td-u">a creative</span> who <span class="td-u">wants an application</span> that would make it easy <span class="td-u">to create/paint 3D objects</span> with the potential <span class="td-u">to be viewed, used, and shared</span> in other apps.
    </p><p class='typography-CS-section-body-light  animated fadeIn wow'>
    He stated there was a four-month deadline to <span class="td-u">create a fully functional Microsoft SurfaceBook demo application</span> in time for Adobe MAX. It should be on-brand with the look and feel — but that there was no internal UI framework we could use for this, and that Sebastian would have to build the UI layer on top of his existing tech demo.
    </p><p class='typography-CS-section-body-light  animated fadeIn wow'>
    I thought about the challanages — understanding the market demands, but with little time for research, a lack of design system (Spectrum was still in it's infancy) and app UI framework, and a tight dealine. Quite a challange. I accepted and we quickly moved forward developing a process and strategy for our small team of three.

    <h3 class="pad-top-tiny animated fadeInDown wow">Goals</h3>

    <h3 class="pad-top-tiny animated fadeInDown wow">Challenges</h3>
    <ul class="lead animated fadeIn wow stagger-children-ease-in">
      <li class="animated fadeIn wow">Very limited research opportunity.</li>
      <li class="animated fadeIn wow">Must develop an on-brand UX and a UI framework.</li>
      <li class="animated fadeIn wow">Need a rapid or automated <strong>design-build workflow*</strong>.</li>

    <h6 class="animated fadeInUp wow">* The build-design workflow is the loop between designer, handing-off a design change list or updated specification, and engineer, implementing the functionality or feature in the application for testing. This progression can also be started by the engineer with new functionality that can be vetted for a feature. Engineers are creatives too.</h6>

      Creating a touch-first application supported by a stylus was a primary goal. Also, we needed to make sure it was on-brand both in UI and anticipated experience.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Developing for Windows is out of my comfort zone, although I have done it in the past.
      Creating the branded UI elements from scratch would be another hurdle, and finding an easy, quick path to implementing them yet another.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      The challenge of having no research available wasn&#39;t as much of an issue, as I have a history deep history with users, partners, and stakeholders of Photoshop&#39;s 3D tools and experience, as well as other apps and users.
      Moreso, I had plenty of (unsuspecting) users roaming the hallways of Adobe that I could, and would, enlist their services to understand additional user perspectives about this particular product.

      The two main iterations are the weekly design sprints and the continuous design-build loop.
      The diamond line for each iteration shows how we diverge to create choices and converge to make choices.
      &lt;br &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      We broke the design sprint into weekly check-ins to align goals and focus on the workflow(s) we were addressing currently.
      The rest of the week we were in a real-time design-build loop.
      &lt;br &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Sebastian (engineer) would work on refining the application core, exposing hooks (menu items) for the workflow(s), and building out the UI layout engine.
      I would refine workflows, update documentation, and build-out features and UI elements.
      Additionally, I would take the app to stakeholders to have them use/play with the app, to gauge and fine-tune our efforts.
      &lt;br &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      When we had an update or feature request, we would send it to the other to implement.
      More importantly, we decided to work on a UI framework that drew from gaming and create an atlas map. It would contain all of the UI elements; panels, buttons, text, sliders, everything.
      We would also incorporate a text file with a naming convention that corresponds to each image and its coordinates in the texture atlas.
      &lt;br &gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Replacing the files updates the application in real-time. If the actions were not available, the UI would be present for Stephen (engineer) to add them.
      He could draw from the texture atlas to put together a UI panel to test functionality.
      We could build the application together without being blocked, which was an incredible performance boost.

      With many engineers who focus on core technology, the UI consists of a menu bar of grouped logical functions, some status information on the screen, and a way to input data.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Sections of the menu are file management, brush controls, filters, and view settings.
      The status information on the screen shows the state of the current file&#39;s settings; brush size, view type, and any debug information that could help.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Having no UI directs the user view, keeping the objects and tasks at hand — a principle I have uses for several projects that focus on images or 3D workspaces.
      It allows us to focus on users&#39; needs and implement a UI that is easy to understand and use.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      The exciting and potentially complicated aspect of the SurfaceBook was the ability to use various inputs; touch, multitouch, stylus with pressure and tilt, trackpad, or keyboard.
      We would need to exploit the functionality in a way that would be useful for the user.

      The menu bar, workspace switcher, panels, and tools or toolbars are almost always in the same layout.
      It is one of the advantages of having a known UI paradigm, but we would still need to figure out how to recreate it without the other apps&#39; UI framework.
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      Working through my conversation with Stefan, I could see how a user might want to use the app.
      I began to assign functionality in the UI, workspace switcher at the top, auto-hiding panels to the left and right, and on-screen controls.
      We would present the UI as necessary and make it easy to move it out of the way.
      It will be familiar to users, making it seem less scary or complicated.

    Since I did not have the research to empathize with the user, I needed to figure out how to identify the user and their motivations.
    Next, I would need to dream up a branded interface that was flexible to handle new UI elements and functionality.
    I could then work with Sebastian, and the user data, to refine user workflows, implement the design-build loop, and start building the new application.

    We utilized the hardware to extend the user experience by using the accelerometer to move the 3D canvas object, and device camera to project the 3D canvas into the real-world.
    </p><p class='typography-CS-section-body-light  animated fadeIn wow'>
    I worked closely with Sebastian to incorporate the ability to use two-handed input, including overloading the gestures to perform more than one at a time. This allows a user to use one hand to interact with the camera, simultaneously orbiting, rotating, and moving towards or away from the 3D canvas, all while using the other hand (or trackpad, or stylus) to paint in the 3D canvas.

      When a user is holding the device, their dominant hand acts as the input device, and their passive hand holds the device.

      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      We also accounted for sequential tap/touch events and durational events (touch/click/tap and hold).
      In the end, we created a complex array of input mechanisms due to the variety of input methods.
      We were able to maintain continuity through the various inputs so that it would be intuitive and minimize the user&#39;s learning curve.

      We experimented with using a two-axis input system.
      It provided a different mechanic for the user to adjust settings.
